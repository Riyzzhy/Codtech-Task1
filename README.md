Overview about my Project
Project: Anime Popularity Classification using the decision_Tree by visualization model.

This project focuses on building a Decision Tree Classifier using the Anime dataset from Kaggle to predict whether an anime is Popular or Unpopular based on specific features. The primary goal is to demonstrate classification techniques using Scikit-Learn, along with effective data preprocessing, feature engineering, and visualization.
We use the anime.csv file, which contains metadata about anime shows including their genre, user rating, and the number of members who have interacted with the anime. The members feature is used as a key indicator of popularity.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
Load and preprocess the Anime dataset.
Convert raw features like genre and members into machine-learning-friendly formats.
Build a binary classification model using Decision Trees.
Visualize the resulting decision tree for interpretability.
Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy and classification metrics.
Tune hyperparameters to optimize performance.

ðŸ“š Machine Learning Concepts Used Decision Tree Classification
Feature Encoding (Categorical to Numerical)
Train/Test Split
Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)
Model Visualization
Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV
